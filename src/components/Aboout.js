          <p className="lorem">Our mission since we started has stayed simple: introduce our customers to the estates we directly buy our great tasting coffee from, roast <br /> the beans with care, and make high quality coffee more accessible through our cafes and our website. The coffee we roast is the coffee we <br /> like to drink, and we hope you like it too.</p>
          <br />
          <li className='font'>At Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, we follow a simple set of beliefs.</li>
          <li className='font'>TRANSPARENCY IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST WHERE WE GET OUR BEANS FROM.</li>
          <p className='lorem'>The first thing we did when we started our company was to highlight our award winning farms. This idea of transparency organically evolved <br /> to the way we worked in other areas too - our baristas are always present to discuss brewing tips, our customer service team are there to walk <br /> you through your coffee questions, and our roasting team to show you how they work.</p><br />
          <li className='font'>A CULTURE OF CONSTANT LEARNING IS THE KEY TO ALWAYS PUSHING COFFEE FORWARD.</li>
          <p className='lorem'>We are consistently researching, testing and implementing best practices throughout our business to raise the bar. Making refractometers <br /> essential for our cafe brewing, holding advanced sensory learnings for junior roasters, and experimenting with processing at the farm level are <br /> just some of the ways that our highly skilled team is constantly evolving the way Indian coffee is treated, experienced or communicated <br /> about.</p><br />
          <li className='font'>SOURCING THE BEST COFFEE BEANS DOES NOT GUARANTEE GOOD COFFEE.</li>
          <p className='lorem'>Although we have a dedicated sourcing team for green beans and have invested in establishing quality roasting parameters, we know that a lot <br /> more steps still have to fall into place to brew a good cup. This is why we have worked hard to create coffee training centres to impart leading <br /> procedures such as equipping baristas with assessing and reporting tools for precision brewing, and cupping every single batch that is roasted <br /> to ensure consistent quality.</p>
